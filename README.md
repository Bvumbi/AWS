# AWS
AWS Projects to showcase cloud engineering skills.

I am a passionate cloud engineer who enjoys building cloud infrastructures in the cloud where enterprises systems can run securely, efficiently, reliably, scalably and cost-effectively. With 27 years of experience in IT Support, I like staying up to date with all available technologies and tools so I have a broad spectrum of options to choose from in order to design, build, test, deploy and maintain a highly available and scalable cloud solution.
